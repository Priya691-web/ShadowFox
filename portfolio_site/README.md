# Personal Portfolio Website - Beginner Template

This is a simple, responsive personal portfolio template using plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Open `index.html` in your browser to view it.

## How to run locally
1. Unzip the provided `portfolio_site.zip` (if zipped).
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
   - Or run a local server for better results: `python -m http.server 8000` then open `http://localhost:8000`

## How to customize
- Replace "Your Name" in `index.html`.
- Edit the About text and project descriptions.
- Replace images in `assets/` with your screenshots (keep filenames or update paths).
- Update the email in `script.js` (mailto) to receive messages.

## Deploy
- Push these files to a GitHub repository and enable GitHub Pages (set branch to `main` and folder to `/`).
- Or use Netlify/Vercel for drag-and-drop deployments.

Have fun â€” and ask me if you want a template using a CSS framework (Bootstrap/Tailwind) or a static site generator.
